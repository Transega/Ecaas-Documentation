Data Collection Process
#######################

Data collection Entailed a couple of activities that are important in order to allow for accurate representation of the dataset.
Moreover, the project also envisaged that not only vector gesopatial datasets are collected but also raster datasets.

a.  Identification of the targeted crops in each of the countries of interest.

b.  Identification of specific areas that the targeted crops are grown in each of the country.

c.  Identification season that each individual crop is grown (Long Rains & Short Rains).

d.  Stratification of the areas and scientific sampling procedures for accurate data capture

c.  Planning field visits in tandem with crop and season.

e.  Planning of Drone Image acquisition based on crop season and weather information and other flight Planning processes.


*****************************
Targeted Crops Identification
*****************************

The crops were targeted based on the impact envisaged for this program, this is because the program 
is supposed to offer crop analytics at scale. Therefore the rationale for identification of crops 
was majorly on crops that are widely grown by majorly small holder farmers in the countries of interest.

The program also sought to provide data for these crops that are widely grown with no existic publicly available 
datasets and thus bringing about predictability since, data would be available, for simulation of future seasons and prediction.
Moreover, the program brings about an oportunity to understand spatial and temporal distribuition of crops, information on growing period and 
various challenges that farmers go through. This would later inturn inform product development at PULA, patners and authorities.

*The crops were identified through various means;*

Research was done on the major crops small holder farmers grow through reading of publicly available reports.
It was also complemented with resources available at PULA where there a dedicated call center that was used as 
a reference to get views directly from calls made to farmers. Enumerators were also used in finding out distribuition and crop types grown 
accross different areas.

Identification of Areas where Crops are Grown
*********************************************

Having the crop types identified, it is important to focus specific areas that are under-represented when it comes to availability 
of data, but with a good number of farmers.

The process entailed an elaborate desktop analysis prior zoning to the areas that were deemed suitable, this was done using remote sensing approach
of crop suitability mapping. It is achieved by integration of a  number of data products from various sensors mainly;

* Rainfall.

* Soil Moisture 

* Topography

* Temprature 

* Soil 

To efficiently manage the process, Agro-ecological zones were used as the geographical units in doing the analysis. 
*Agro-ecologocal zones are units of land that exhibit similarilities or homogeneority in terms of soil and climate conditions.*
Thus, if crops were to be grown in an Agro-ecological zone they may have similarilities in growing patterns and length. 

Vegetation indices were developed and integrated with the aforementioned datasets to form basis of crop suitability mapping,
this entailed analysis such as land and water productivity.
