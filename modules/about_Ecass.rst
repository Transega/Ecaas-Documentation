Background Information
#######################

Welcome to the technical documentation of the Bird's-Eye project, 
a collaboration between Pula and Tetra Tech under the Enabling Crop Analytics at Scale Project. 
This work, funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, 
is meant to foster the collection of Ground truth georeferenced 
Agriculture labelled datasets that would improve predictive analytics in 
smallholder agriculture, through the use of Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) and satellite imagery.

The twenty-first century has presented the most devastating effects of climate change, 
especially in sub-Saharan Africa. These effects are packaged with climate variability that adversely affects small-holder farmers.

Towards resilience building, agricultural statistics and farm evidence is proving a key variable in mitigating 
the effects of climate change. However, these activities have been faced with challenges in data gaps that can 
be used to train and validate machine learning and artificial intelligence models.

Agricultural statistics (ag-stats) entails the generation of geo-referenced farm information including 
basic information such as land ownership and size. Ag-stats information will enable the consequent support 
in generating scientific information, including crop-type mapping, and the generation of crop masks in different agro-ecological zones.

With accurate crop masks data, yield forecasting will then be possible, of which a ripple 
effect on mitigation measures and preparedness on food security policy can be achieved.
