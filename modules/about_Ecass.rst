Welcome to the technical documentation of Enabling Crop Analytics at Scale (ECAAS).

ECAAS project is an initiative by Tetra Tech firm, funded by Melinda and Bill Foundation 
whose main aim is to foster collection of Ground truth georeferenced Agriculture 
labelled datasets that would improve predictive analytics in smallholder agriculture, 
through use of Artificial intelligence, Machhine Learning (AI/ML) and satellite imagery.

The twenty-first century has presented the most devastating effects on climate change,especially in the sub-saharan Africa.
These effects are packaged with climate variability that adversely affects small-holder farmers. Towards resilience building,
agricultural statistics and farm evidences is proving a key variable towards mitigating effects of climate change. However, these activities have 
been faced with challenges in data gaps that can be used to train and validate machine learning and artifical intelligence models. 

Agricultural statistics (Ag-stats) entails generation of georeferenced farm information including basic information such as land ownership and size.
Ag-stats information will enabale the consequent support in generating scientifc information, including crop-type mapping, and the 
generation of crop-masks in different agro-ecological zones. With accurate crop masks data, yield forecasting will then be possible, of which 
a ripple effect on mitigation measures and prepairdness on food security policy can be achieved.
