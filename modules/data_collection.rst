Data Collection Process
#######################

Data collection Entailed a couple of activities that are important in order to allow for accurate representation of the dataset.
Moreover, the project also envisaged that not only vector gesopatial datasets are collected but also raster datasets.

a.  Identification of the targeted crops in each of the countries of interest.

b.  Identification of specific areas that the targeted crops are grown in each of the country.

c.  Identification season that each individual crop is grown (Long Rains & Short Rains).

d.  Stratification of the areas and scientific sampling procedures for accurate data capture

c.  Planning field visits in tandem with crop and season.

e.  Planning of Drone Image acquisition based on crop season and weather information and other flight Planning processes.

Targeted Crops Identification
*****************************

The crops were targeted based on the impact envisaged for this program, this is because the program 
is supposed to offer crop analytics at scale. Therefore the rationale for identification of crops 
was majorly on crops that are widely grown by majorly small holder farmers in the countries of interest.

The program also sought to provide data for these crops that are widely grown with no existic publicly available 
datasets and thus bringing about predictability since, data would be available, for simulation of future seasons and prediction.
Moreover, the program brings about an oportunity to understand spatial and temporal distribuition of crops, information on growing period and 
various challenges that farmers go through. This would later inturn inform product development at PULA, patners and authorities.
